## Questions:
# 1) What version of Python are you running?
  # I am running the Python 3.11.3 version.

# 2) Did the commands work as you expected?
  # For the most part I wasn't surprised by the command outputs, but I didn't know what the 'mkdir:' command would do until I ran it. 

# 3) How do you run a Python program for the QT Console? 
  # I opened QT Console through the Anaconda Navigator, so I already had my environment set with the Python packages. When I installed and ran QT Console, it was already set to Python because of this.
